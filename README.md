# GodotPracticeGames
These files are going to serve as a basis for most of my games for npw just because I am new to this. It's all from the Godot documentation.
I'm just putting them here for safe keeping and so I never lose them. Theres also some other misc player scripts in here and I will also add my own scripts eventually.
